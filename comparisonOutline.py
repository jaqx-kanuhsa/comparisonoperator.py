This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = ("Aaron Rodgers" == "Gone")
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b = (99=|-99|) 
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

c = (32>3)
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (19<33)
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

e = (14>=14)
print(e)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

f = (19<=20)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

e = (19>="30")
